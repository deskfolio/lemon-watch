# About
Lemon Watch is a sample apple Watch app extension for Lemon Cash on iOS.

# Scope

### Considerations
The app intentionally does not offer support for viewing market, past transactions, or any other section found within the main mobile app. It wasn't concieved as a 1:1 translation to a new device, but as a companion app where the user can quickly manage the card and most of its functionalities, without the hassle of using the mobile app.

### Functionality

The app only offers two different but convenient features:

1. See and change the current status of the Lemon Card (Pause/Resume)
2. See the different wallets and its balances, and select a currency/coin for making payments with the card



### Navigation

The app consists of a two section tabbed navigation, and each of them offer one of the functionalities/features described above.
